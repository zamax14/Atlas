## Unreleased

> Atlas has not been released yet. Everything before this section is pre-release scaffolding —
> packaging, CI, the development PostGIS environment, tests and documentation — which the
> convention keeps out of the changelog. The public API lands in `0.1.0`; see
> [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md).
